# :wave: Hey, I'm Erick.

I'm an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Central Florida (UCF). I have a passion for graphics programming and game development; in my free time, I enjoy working with computer graphics and procedural VFX.

I am a member of UCF's competitive programming team, and have competed in ACM/ICPC at the regional level. I have a particular enthusiasm for problems in computational geometry and the applications thereof.

I've worked as a freelance developer and motion graphics artist, as well as a systems programmer with a small indie games studio. Most recently I performed undergraduate research at Imperial College London, working under Prof. Gerard Gorman to implement reduced- and mixed-precision support for [the Devito DSL and compiler framework](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito).
