# :wave: Hey, I'm Erick.

I'm an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Central Florida. I have a passion for graphics programming and game development; in my free time, I enjoy working with computer graphics and procedural VFX. I am a member of UCF's competitive programming team, and have competed in ACM/ICPC at the regional level. I have a particular enthusiasm for problems in computational geometry and the applications thereof.

I'm currently performing undergraduate research at Imperial College London, working with the Devito group under Prof. Gerard Gorman to implement reduced- and mixed-precision support for the automated generation of high-performance finite difference kernels.
